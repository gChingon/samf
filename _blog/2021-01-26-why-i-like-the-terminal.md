# Why I like using terminal

Well to be honest, I was not originally a fan of terminal. I wasn't afraid of it so to speak, I just did no think I had any use for it. But I stumbled onto Plex around 2005. At the time, I think Netflix only "rented" DVDs via mail. So I would rip copies of DVDs/Blu Rays using Handbrake. Storing them to be viewed via Plex. However to use Plex back then, you basically needed an HTPC or simply watch on your computer that held the files you would watch. It wasn't until apple TV 3 that one could jailbreak and add Plex app to be able to use Plex to watch TV/Movies. But to do so, one would have to "tinker" with things.
