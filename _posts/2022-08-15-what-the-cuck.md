I'm joined in this episode by Trooth, from Trooth be Told podcast. He is boldly breaking down barriers and sharing a kink of his and goes on to explain what it is and how he discovered it. We also dive into perceptions about machismo, masculinity and western culture and how we deal with sex and sex education as a society. All this and more in this episode
