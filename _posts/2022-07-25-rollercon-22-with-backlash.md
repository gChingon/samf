Today I caught up with a skater friend from San Antonio, The one and ONLY Backlash. She's a skater friend for the past 5 ish years now, man how time flies. Anywho, I ran into her during registration at RollerCon and a few other times in passing. It was nearly the end of RC (RollerCon) before I was able to get her on camera for a few minutes between bouts she was playing and I was annoucing/DJing. So listen in to a convo with Backlash a Skater from Alamo City Roller Girls and we chat about dating and what she and most women look for in a guy.
