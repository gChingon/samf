This episode covers the tragedy that happens every day hundreds of times over, and seeing the results of it on Reddit and hearing about it in my social circles. Both online and "In Real Life"

That issue is not knowing if a date went as well as you thought and whether your date is into you. I share my example of how I end a date and let them know that I like them. Find out what I say and the small group of females that always get a second date and also know that their dates are into them.
